Any change to these Terms applies only to purchases made, and other use of the Platform, after the change is posted on the Platform. By continuing to use the Platform, you agree to be bound by the Terms as changed from time to time.

To the extent that Merchantsâ€™ own terms and conditions applying to your purchases from them are inconsistent with these Terms, these Terms will take precedence and apply to the extent of the inconsistency.
